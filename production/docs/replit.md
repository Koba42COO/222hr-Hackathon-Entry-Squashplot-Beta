# SquashPlot - Advanced Chia Plot Compression Tool

## Overview

SquashPlot Enhanced is a production-ready integration wrapper that combines Mad Max plotting speed with BladeBit compression capabilities through intelligent pipeline orchestration. The system delivers "smaller, faster plotting" by seamlessly integrating these powerful tools with a unified CLI interface compatible with existing Chia plotting workflows.

The enhanced wrapper provides hardware-aware resource optimization, multi-plot coordination, robust tool detection, and real-time performance monitoring. It automatically selects optimal plotting strategies based on available tools and hardware capabilities, maximizing throughput while minimizing storage requirements through efficient compression.
