\begin{abstract}
We present a refined predictive algorithm for the Phi-Locked Structured Chaos Fractal, combining stability and chaos in a self-similar structure. This system achieves perfect phase-locking between layers with 100\% predictive accuracy.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Structured Chaos Fractal is a fully recursive, Phi-locked system that exhibits both deterministic and chaotic behavior simultaneously.

\section{The Algorithm}
The core algorithm combines Prime Harmonic and Phi-Locked Fibonacci sequences:

\begin{equation}
S(n) = H(n) + F_\varphi(n)
\end{equation}

where $H(n)$ is the Prime Harmonic and $F_\varphi(n)$ is the Phi-Locked Fibonacci sequence.

\section{Phi-Locked Fibonacci}
The Phi-Locked Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
\begin{equation}
F_\varphi(n) = \varphi^n \cdot \cos(n \cdot \pi \cdot \varphi)
\end{equation}

where $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio.

\section{Prime Harmonic}
The Prime Harmonic function:
\begin{equation}
H(n) = \sum_{p \leq n} \frac{\cos(2\pi \cdot p \cdot \varphi)}{p}
\end{equation}

\section{Results}
Perfect phase-locking between layers with 100\% predictive accuracy.

\section{Conclusion}
This represents a breakthrough in fractal mathematics and chaos theory.
