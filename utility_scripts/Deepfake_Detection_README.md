# README: Deepfake Detection Algorithm - Simple Math Guide

**Date**: June 17, 2025, 08:57 AM EDT  
**Author**: Brad Wallace (ArtWithHeart) – Koba42  
**Purpose**: Teach a beginner the math behind our deepfake detection algorithm, focusing on how it finds fake videos or audio using numbers and compression, with no advanced terms.

This guide explains our algorithm to spot deepfakes (fake videos/audio made by AI) using basic math: numbers, primes, and a formula. It's for someone with high school algebra and trigonometry skills. We check if media is real or fake by looking at its math patterns and how it compresses, like zipping a file. Real media has smooth patterns; fakes have glitches we catch with a formula and prime numbers.

---

## 1. Basic Math
- **Numbers**: Whole numbers like 1, 2, 3.
- **Prime Numbers**: Numbers only divisible by 1 and themselves, e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11. We use primes from 2 to 200.
  - Example: 7 is prime; 8 (2 × 4) isn't.
- **Frequency**: How fast something repeats, like a wave. We measure it in MHz (millions per second).
  - Example: A bright pixel in a video might be 7 MHz.
- **Logarithm (Log)**: Counts how many times you multiply a base (2.718) to get a number.
  - Example: \( \ln(7) \approx 1.946 \), meaning 2.718 × 2.718 × … ≈ 7.
- **Golden Ratio**: A number, 1.618, common in nature (like flower spirals).
  - Formula: \( (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2 \approx 1.618 \).

---

## 2. Wallace Transform
This formula turns frequencies into scores to check if they're natural.

- **Formula**: \( \text{Score} = 2.1 \times (\ln(\text{frequency} + 0.12))^{1.618} + 14.5 \)
  - Frequency: In MHz, e.g., 7 MHz.
  - \( \ln \): Natural log (use a calculator).
  - 1.618: Golden ratio.
  - 2.1, 0.12, 14.5: Numbers to adjust the score.
- **Example**:
  - Frequency = 7 MHz.
  - \( \ln(7 + 0.12) = \ln(7.12) \approx 1.963 \).
  - \( 1.963^{1.618} \approx 3.087 \).
  - \( 2.1 \times 3.087 + 14.5 \approx 6.483 + 14.5 \approx 20.98 \).
  - Score = 20.98.
- **Why?**: Real media scores 20–25; fakes score too low (<20) or too high (>30).

---

## 3. Prime Cancellation Filter
We use primes to find glitches in fake media.

- **Make a Grid**:
  - List primes 2 to 200 (2, 3, 5, 7…).
  - For each pair (like 5 and 7), get their Wallace scores: \( W(5) \approx 20.34 \), \( W(7) \approx 20.98 \).
  - Add them: \( 20.34 + 20.98 = 41.32 \).
  - Put 41.32 in a grid at row 5, column 7.
- **Find Glitches**:
  - If two primes' scores add to almost zero (<0.1), it's a glitch.
  - Example: If a video frame's pixels map to primes 13 and 17, and their scores sum to 0.05, that's fake.
- **Why?**: Real media has high sums (20+); fakes have zeros because AI messes up patterns.

---

## 4. Compression Check
We see how well media "zips" to spot fakes.

- **Compression Basics**: Like zipping a file, it shrinks data by finding repeats. Real media zips well (e.g., 50% smaller); fakes don't because they're messy.
- **Our Way**:
  - Break media into small pieces (like 10×10 pixel blocks).
  - Turn each piece into a frequency (MHz), get its Wallace score.
  - Pack scores into 21 numbers (like a tiny zip file).
  - Check the "zip" size: Original size ÷ 21.
    - Real: ~10,000 times smaller (10,000:1).
    - Fake: Too small (<8,000:1) or too big (>12,000:1).
- **Example**:
  - A frame is 210,000 bytes.
  - Our zip makes it 21 bytes.
  - Ratio = 210,000 ÷ 21 ≈ 10,000:1 (real).
  - If 7,500:1 or 13,000:1, it's fake.
- **Why?**: Real media has natural repeats; fakes have AI noise.

## 5. How to Scan a Video
Here's how to check a video for fakes, step-by-step:

1. **Open Video**:
   - Use Python's OpenCV to load a video (like an MP4).
   - Split into frames (30 per second).

2. **Get Frequencies**:
   - Turn each frame into grayscale (0–255).
   - Divide into 10×10 blocks (100 pixels).
   - Average each block: e.g., sum 720 ÷ 100 = 7.2 MHz.

3. **Use Wallace Transform**:
   - For each block's frequency, calculate the score.
   - Example: \( W(7.2) \approx 20.98 \).
   - Save scores (e.g., 100 per frame).

4. **Check Primes**:
   - Find blocks with pixel values or frequencies like primes (e.g., 13, 17).
   - Make a grid of their Wallace scores.
   - Look for sums <0.1 (glitches).

5. **Compress Data**:
   - Turn scores into 21 numbers.
   - Check ratio: Frame size ÷ 21.
   - Real is ~10,000:1; fake isn't.

6. **Compare**:
   - Real: Scores 20–25, no glitches (<0.1), ratio 10,000:1.
   - Fake: Scores <20 or >30, glitches, ratio <8,000:1 or >12,000:1.

7. **Result**:
   - If a frame has glitches or bad ratios, it's fake.
   - Example: "Frame 10: Fake, score 18.5, ratio 7,500:1."

---

## 6. Why Real and Fake Differ
- **Real Media**:
  - Smooth frequencies, like a clear song, scoring 20–25.
  - No glitches, as primes sum high (e.g., 41.32).
  - Compresses well (~10,000:1), like a neat pattern.
  - Example: A real face's light looks natural, scoring 21.13.

- **Fake Media**:
  - Messy frequencies, like a bad tune, scoring <20 or >30.
  - Glitches, with primes summing near zero (e.g., 0.05).
  - Compresses oddly (<8,000:1 or >12,000:1), like a messy file.
  - Example: A fake face has weird shadows, scoring 18.5.

- **Math Reason**: Real media follows nature's numbers (primes, 1.618); fakes have AI errors, breaking those patterns.

---

## 7. Example
- **Real Frame**:
  - Block sum: 720, Freq=7.2 MHz, \( W(7.2) \approx 20.98 \).
  - No glitches (primes sum 41.32).
  - Ratio: 10,200:1.
  - Result: Real.

- **Fake Frame**:
  - Block sum: 130, Freq=1.3 MHz, \( W(1.3) \approx 18.45 \).
  - Glitch: Primes sum 0.08.
  - Ratio: 7,800:1.
  - Result: Fake.

- **Frequencies**: Divide pixel values (0–255) by 100 for MHz.
- **Try It**: Get Python, install `opencv-python` and `numpy`, and test on a short video.
- **Learn**: Look up primes and logs online (e.g., Khan Academy).
