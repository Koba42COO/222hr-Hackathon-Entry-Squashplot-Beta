## 🔐 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Core Components

#### 1. GunDB Integration (`GUNDB_BROWSER_WALLET_CONNECT.html`)
```javascript
// Real-time data synchronization
const gun = Gun(['https://gun-manhattan.herokuapp.com/gun']);
const marketplace = gun.get('blockchain_marketplace');

// Decentralized storage
marketplace.get('contributions').get(id).put(contributionData);

// Real-time updates
marketplace.map().on((data) => {
    updateUI(data);
});
```

#### 2. Blockchain Backend (`BLOCKCHAIN_KNOWLEDGE_MARKETPLACE.py`)
```python
# Smart contract deployment
smart_contract = SmartContract(
    address="0x...",
    abi=contract_abi
)

# Payment processing
payment = marketplace.use_contribution(wallet, contribution_id)
```

#### 3. Browser Wallet Integration
```javascript
// MetaMask connection
const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: 'eth_requestAccounts'
});

// Transaction signing
const signature = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: 'personal_sign',
    params: [message, account]
});
```
