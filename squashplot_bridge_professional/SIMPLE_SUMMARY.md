# SquashPlot Bridge - Simple Summary

## What It Is

SquashPlot Bridge is a secure web interface that lets you run commands on your computer safely. It's like having a remote control for your computer that only allows safe, pre-approved commands.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Bridge**: Run `python SquashPlotBridge.py`
2. **Open Web Interface**: Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser
3. **Execute Commands**: Click buttons to run safe, pre-approved scripts
4. **See Results**: Watch as commands execute on your computer

## What It Does

### Demo Script
- **Hello World Demo**: Opens Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) with a "Hello World!" message
- **Proves It Works**: Shows that the bridge can actually control your computer
- **Safe Execution**: Only runs one pre-approved script

### Security Features
- **Whitelist Only**: Only approved commands can run
- **No Hackers**: Can't run dangerous commands like deleting files
- **Safe Scripts**: All commands are tested and safe

## Supported Systems

- **Windows**: Opens Notepad with Hello World message
- **Mac**: Opens TextEdit with Hello World message  
- **Linux**: Opens text editor with Hello World message

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Bridge
```bash
python SquashPlotBridge.py
```

### 2. Open Your Browser
The bridge will automatically open your browser to the web interface.

### 3. Execute Demo
Click "Execute Demo Script" to see the Hello World demonstration.

### 4. Watch It Work
Notepad (or your text editor) will open with the Hello World message!

## Why It's Safe

- **Only One Command**: Currently only allows the Hello World demo
- **Server-Side**: Commands run on your computer, not in the browser
- **Whitelist**: Only pre-approved commands are allowed
- **No Internet**: Everything runs locally on your computer

## What You'll See

### In Your Browser
- Professional web interface
- Status indicators showing the bridge is working
- Buttons to execute the demo script
- Output showing what's happening

### On Your Computer
- Notepad opens with "Hello World! SquashPlot Bridge is working!"
- A text file is created with the message
- Proves the system can actually control your computer

## Perfect For

- **Demonstrations**: Show that web-to-desktop communication works
- **Development**: Test web interfaces that need to control the local computer
- **Education**: Learn how secure bridges work
- **Prototyping**: Build secure command execution systems

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Interface**: Web browser
- **Security**: Whitelist-based command validation
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- **Port**: 8080 (local only)

## Getting Help

If something doesn't work:
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Check that port 8080 isn't being used by another program
3. Try refreshing your browser
4. Check that the bridge server is running

## Next Steps

This is a foundation that can be extended with:
- More approved commands
- User authentication
- Advanced security features
- Custom command sets
