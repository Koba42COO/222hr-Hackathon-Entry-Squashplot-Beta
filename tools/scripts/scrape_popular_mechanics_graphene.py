        Graphene Defies Wiedemann-Franz Law: Quantum Fluid Behavior Discovery
        
        Scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, India, and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan have discovered that graphene, when tuned to its Dirac point, behaves like a quantum fluid and defies the well-established Wiedemann-Franz law of physics.
        
        Key Discovery:
        - Graphene flouts the Wiedemann-Franz law at its Dirac point
        - Shows 200-fold deviation from the law's predictions
        - Exhibits inverse relationship between thermal and electrical conductivity
        - Behaves like a quantum fluid approaching "perfect fluid" properties
        - Similar to quark-gluon plasma from the Big Bang
        
        Technical Innovation:
        - Dirac point: moment when material is neither metal nor insulator
        - Subatomic structure behaves like quantum fluid
        - Approaches properties of perfect fluid with no viscosity
        - First universally-applicable experimental evaluation of electric conductivity
        - Low-cost platform for high-energy physics research
        
        Physics Breakthrough:
        - Wiedemann-Franz law states thermal/electrical conductivity ratio proportional to temperature
        - Graphene shows inverse relationship: thermal conductivity increases as electrical decreases
        - 200-fold deviation from established physics law
        - Opens new possibilities for quantum material research
        
        Scientific Significance:
        - Similar to quark-gluon plasma in Large Hadron Collider at CERN
        - Represents primordial soup of universe after Big Bang
        - Enables study of black-hole thermodynamics
        - Platform for entanglement entropy scaling research
        - Powerful quantum sensor for weak magnetic fields
        
        Applications:
        - High-energy physics research platform
        - Astrophysics concept exploration
        - Black-hole thermodynamics study
        - Quantum sensor development
        - Low-cost alternative to expensive particle accelerators
        
        Research Details:
        - Published in Nature Physics journal
        - Led by Arindam Ghosh at IISc Bengaluru
        - Collaboration with National Institute for Materials Science, Japan
        - Builds on 2016 Science journal study
        - 20 years after graphene's 2004 discovery by Nobel Prize winners
