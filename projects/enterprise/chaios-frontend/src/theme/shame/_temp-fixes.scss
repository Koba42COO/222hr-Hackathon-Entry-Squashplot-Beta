// chAIos Shame Layer - Temporary Fixes
// ====================================
// CLEANED UP: All temporary fixes have been moved to proper locations
// This file is now empty as intended for production builds

// No temporary fixes remain - all styles have been properly organized
// into their respective theme layers:
// - Ionic overrides → vendor/ionic-overrides.scss
// - Layout utilities → utilities/helpers.scss
// - Browser fixes → base/reset.scss
// - Performance optimizations → utilities/animations.scss

// PRODUCTION NOTE: This file should remain empty in production builds
// Any new temporary fixes added here must include:
// 1. TODO comment with specific refactor plan
// 2. Issue ticket reference when available
// 3. Estimated timeline for proper implementation
// 4. Clear description of the problem being solved

// DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES:
// - Only critical fixes that can't wait for proper solution
// - Regular review and cleanup required (monthly)
// - No new features should be added here
// - All fixes must have migration plan to proper location
